## RSE South Workshop 16th May 2023 {.tbh3}

<p>
On Tuesday, 16th May 2023, members of RSE South, the regional research software engineering network 
in the UK South came together for the first time in person for the RSE South Workshop 2023. Hosted at 
the beautiful Meadow Suite at the University of Reading, delegates from many RSE groups and institutions across 
the South of the UK met for a day of talks, discussion and networking opportunities. In the lead up to the event, 
50 delegates registered and the workshop saw an attendance of around 40 on the day.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
The workshop was funded by the Open Research Action Plan at the University of Reading and inspired the theme 
of the event, namely ‘Sustainability and Reproducibility of Research Software’. Talks were centered around these 
fundamental pillars of reproducibility and also covering a wider range of RSE community topics. The full schedule 
of talks can be found below and slides from the presentations where speakers have granted permission for them to be 
shared are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1kt7p5hRbOs7B49P8r8TUykkYjKuVPK?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>
It was clear that this first RSE South workshop was very much enjoyed by the community and for many attendees 
this was the first opportunity to meet community colleagues in person. The post-event survey received overwhelmingly 
positive feedback with comments centering around the highly interesting and inspiring talks and discussions. Many 
respondents highlighted the need for more networking and discussion time as well as an appetite for more RSE South 
community events of different formats, so this will certainly be taken into account for future planning. Look out 
for our upcoming RSE South activities which we will advertise on slack, our mailing list and the RSE South Website!
